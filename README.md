Analysis scripts related to the processing and visualization of the data in "The DEAD-box helicase Dhh1p couples mRNA decay and translation by monitoring codon optimality." Raw data from this project is available at [the following page on the GEO Archive](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81269)

In this project are three main files:
* Pipeline.py: A script used to convert raw FASTQ files into WIG files using the settings outlined in the paper
* DataGen.py: A script used to extract information from the generated WIG files into processed data tables
* Plot.R: A script used to generate the figures in the paper
